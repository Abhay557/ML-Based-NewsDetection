# üì∞ ML-Based-NewsDetection

*Fake News Detection and Classification using NLP & Machine Learning.*  
This project aims to detect and classify **fake news** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The trained model analyzes news articles and predicts whether they are **real or fake** based on their content.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
In today‚Äôs digital era, misinformation spreads rapidly and can have serious consequences. Distinguishing between **credible journalism** and **fake news** is increasingly difficult.  

This project provides an accessible **ML-powered tool** to automatically analyze and classify news text, promoting **media literacy** and reducing the spread of false information.

## üß† Key Machine Learning Techniques

### **Text Vectorization: TF-IDF**
- Converts unstructured text into numerical format.
- Weights words higher if they are frequent in one article but rare across others.
- Provides strong predictive features for classification.

### **Classification Model: Passive Aggressive Classifier**
- Efficient **online learning** algorithm for text classification.
- Remains *passive* on correct predictions, *aggressive* on mistakes.
- Fast, scalable, and highly accurate (achieved **99.6% accuracy**).

## üéØ Learned Objectives (Skills Demonstrated)

### **Machine Learning & NLP**
- Data Analysis & Cleaning (Pandas)
- Text Preprocessing (NLTK ‚Äì lowercasing, stop-word removal, punctuation removal)
- Feature Engineering (TF-IDF vectorization)
- Model Training (PassiveAggressiveClassifier ‚Äì 99.6% accuracy)
- Model Persistence (Joblib for saving model & vectorizer)

### **Backend Development**
